# Finans game analysis
## The tabletop game Finans
Finans is a Scandinavian tabletop game that resembles the more widely known game Monopoly. What sets Finans apart from Monopoly is the wider range of choices a player can do through out the game. Thus, creating a more complex game. For example, players can in Finans buy something called bonds (even though they don't resemble normal bonds), figuring out what bonds to buy and at what price is key for accumulating money.

## What is covered
This analysis will cover how to crush your friends and family in the game of Finans -which properties that are the best to buy, and which bonds that are best to buy.  And whether or not to build houses on your grounds.

This will be done through modelling the game of Finans as a Markov Chain, and using conditioned expected value and other stochastic methods.
